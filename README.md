# Advanced Android Developer Nanodegree 2017 - Baking App


## Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

## Libraries Used
* [Retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
* [Exoplayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)
* [Espresso](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/)
* [Butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/)

## What will you learn?
* Using Exoplayer to play video/audio files.
* Implementing Widgets.
* Implementing Master Detail layout for good user experience for tablet users.
* Using third party libraries to reduce your work.
* Testing UI (intents and views like recyclerview etc.)
* Handling edge error cases.
* Learning android lifecycle and saving view states wherever required.
* Working with layouts for different screen size and orientations.

## How to run?
#   Simply import the project in android studio, sync gradle if required and run it.

## How to use widgets?
#   Add widget on homescreen -> open baking app -> select any recipe -> come back and voila! Ingredients are in the widget.
